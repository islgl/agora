## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0-alpha] — 2026-04-19

First public preview. Everything stored locally under `~/.agora/`.

### Added

- **Chat runtime** on top of the Vercel AI SDK with Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google providers; per-model configuration and live test.
- **Built-in agent tools** (Rust): `read_file`, `write_file`, `edit_file`, `glob`, `grep`, `bash`, `bash_background`, `read_task_output`, `stop_task` — all scoped to a workspace root.
- **MCP support** — connect external Model Context Protocol servers, persisted and reconnected on launch.
- **Skills** — load markdown-based skill packs from `~/.agora/skills/`; optional script execution gated by a global toggle.
- **Conversation branching** — switch active leaves without losing alternative histories.
- **Agent capabilities** — approval prompts with per-tool allow rules, auto-approve for read-only tools, structured todos, conversation modes (including plan mode), subagents, lifecycle hooks.
- **Export & share** — Markdown and PDF export, plus a share-conversation command.
- **Search** — full-text search across conversations.
- **Default workspace root** — `~/.agora/workspace` applied on first launch so FS/Bash tools have scope without setup; editable via **Settings → General** (type/paste a path or use the directory picker).
- **Legacy-data migration** — one-shot move from `~/Library/Application Support/com.agora.app/` to `~/.agora/` on upgrade.

### Known limitations

- macOS build only; binaries are unsigned (expect a Gatekeeper prompt on first launch).
- No auto-update channel yet — grab new versions from [Releases](https://github.com/islgl/agora/releases).
- Cross-platform builds (Windows / Linux) are planned once CI is wired up.
