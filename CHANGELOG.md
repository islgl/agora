## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Menu bar tray + quick panel** — an `NSStatusItem` tray icon (`Agora` tooltip) opens a 372×430 transparent rounded panel directly under the icon with Quick entry cards (New conversation / Open Agora / Settings), a live Double-Option quick-launch toggle, and Quit. Panel hides on focus loss via `Builder::on_window_event` (catches clicks on our own windows) plus a global `NSEvent` left/right/other-mouse-down monitor (catches clicks in other apps or on the desktop). Tray icon is built from `assets/logo-light.png` via a runtime alpha dilation + halo pass (`dilate_alpha` in `background.rs`) so the silhouette keeps its breathing room at 22pt after macOS template-mode auto-tints it white on dark menu bars.

- **Double-Option launcher window** — a 620-wide 1Password-style spotlight panel summoned by double-tapping ⌥ (gated by the Double-Option quick-launch toggle). Input accepts free text or slash commands; typing `/` grows the window from 120px to 340px and reveals a filtered palette built from the existing `SLASH_COMMANDS` list (↑/↓ navigate, Enter/Tab pick, Esc clears). Enter hides the launcher, shows the main window, and the text is stashed in a new `chatStore.pendingFirstMessage` slot consumed by `ChatArea` as the first user turn of a fresh conversation — the normal chat pipeline handles auto-title + mode-switch + streaming, so `/plan 写测试` from the launcher correctly flips the conversation to plan mode and forwards the remainder to the model. Launcher logo is tinted terracotta red (`var(--primary)`) via `mask-image` so it reads clearly on the card surface. Launcher window replaces the former "open main + create blank conversation" path that the double-tap monitor used.

- **"Share as a gift" card** — gift icon (top-right of the chat window) opens an animated share card styled as a classical elegant gift card: deckled torn-paper edges via `clip-path: path()` (seeded random inward bumps on all four sides), `filter: drop-shadow` on the tilt wrapper so the shadow follows the irregular outline. Upper half: a hand-drawn compass-rose illustration (wobbly concentric circles, 8 spokes with arrowheads, annotation dots, corner cross-hatch) drawn by seeded-RNG SVG paths — same geometry every session. Lower half: "Agora" in Caveat handwriting font + tagline + optional user signature. Background is warm parchment `#F8F4E6` with paper-fiber `repeating-linear-gradient` + canvas-generated grain overlay (`mix-blend-mode: multiply`). Card mounts with a slight tilt spring animation; hover drives 3D `perspective rotateX/Y` tilt (visual only, not exported). Agora logo centred inside the compass in sepia filter. QR bottom-right. **Download PNG** at 2× via `html-to-image`.

- **Personal Assistant Layers** — Agora is no longer just a chat front-end over a tool runtime. Five new on-disk layers under `~/.agora/` shape the agent's identity and knowledge:
  - **Brand Layer** (`config/`): five Markdown files — `SOUL.md` (personality), `USER.md` (identity), `TOOLS.md` (tech preferences), `MEMORY.md` (long-term facts), `AGENTS.md` (system-owned safety rules). Seeded from `src-tauri/templates/` on first launch, injected into every system prompt as `<brand>` XML blocks (`<agents>` > `<soul>` > `<user>` > `<tools>`). User maintains these through chat via `list_brand_files` / `read_brand_file` / `append_brand_file` / `replace_brand_file` / `delete_brand_line` synth tools — no Settings UI. A Rust-side secret denylist refuses to persist API keys / tokens / hex-blob secrets, and the AGENTS.md write path is blocked entirely.
  - **LLM-Wiki Layer** (`wiki/`): structured knowledge pages under `concepts/`, `projects/`, `domains/` with YAML frontmatter (title, tags, category, summary, sources, updated_at). A per-turn selector picks relevant pages and injects them into the system prompt; the chat header shows a `WikiContextChip` listing what got pulled in. Main agent gets full CRUD (`list_wiki_pages` / `read_wiki_page` / `write_wiki_page` / `update_wiki_index` / `delete_wiki_page`); subagents only read.
  - **Raw Layer** (`raw/`): a drop-inbox for articles / papers / notes. A `notify`-backed file watcher emits `wiki-ingest-request` events, a background subagent turns each drop into a Wiki page (PDF support via `pdf-extract`). `list_raw_files` lets the main agent answer "what's in my inbox?"; `open_agora_folder` hands the user a Finder window via `opener:allow-open-path`.
  - **Auto Memory** (SQLite `memory_auto` table + HNSW in-RAM index): a post-turn extractor embeds candidate facts via OpenAI or Gemini embeddings (configurable via `embedding_provider` / `embedding_model` / `auto_memory_enabled` global settings) and stores them as packed `f32` blobs. A semantic recall block rides above the Wiki block in the system prompt. Main agent curates via `list_auto_memories` / `delete_auto_memory` — no Settings UI. HNSW rehydrates from SQLite on startup.
  - **Dreaming** (`dreams/`): nightly distillation job. An opportunistic trigger on app mount (2-6 AM local, >20h since last run) reads the day's turn log from `logs/` and produces candidate Brand/Memory edits as JSON under `dreams/YYYY-MM-DD.json`. User reviews via `list_dreams` / `read_dream` / `discard_dream` and accepts candidates through the existing `append_brand_file` tool.
- **Mid-turn user interrupts** — text-only queued messages now auto-inject into the next `tool_result` as a `<user-interrupt>` block instead of waiting for a manual ➤ click. A new `user_interrupt` message part records what the user said and when, rendered inline in the transcript as a muted right-aligned bubble with timestamp. Stream-end auto-dispatches any remaining queued messages (originally manual-only — the extra click was busywork); attachment-bearing messages still need ➤ because they can't ride a text-only tool_result. Clicking ➤ mid-stream cancels and re-sends. Chip color reflects state (primary tint = will auto-inject, amber = stuck on attachments, neutral = manual).
- **Constitutional self-check** — every turn prepends a 3-item `<constitution>` block (safety / privacy / irreversibility) below `<brand>` so `<agents>` rules are in scope. Three items on purpose: Anthropic's practical guidance is that CAI degrades past ~5 rules.
- **Remember-intent nudge** — bilingual trigger phrases ("记住", "请记住", "from now on", "remember that", …) mark the turn so the model decides whether to call `append_brand_file`. Never routes on keywords directly — too many false positives in ordinary chat.
- **Type-ahead message queue** — the composer no longer locks during a running stream. Submissions while a response is in flight land on a per-conversation pending queue rendered as chips above the composer. Drain is manual (➤ per chip), so an assistant that ends with an inline clarification question ("do you mean A or B?") can't silently eat a queued follow-up. `/plan`, `/execute`, etc. re-parse at send time, not at queue time. Stream cancel leaves the queue intact; deleting the conversation clears it.
- **Push-to-main CHANGELOG guard** — `.claude/hooks/require-changelog-on-push.sh` registered as a Claude Code PreToolUse hook via `.claude/settings.json`. Blocks `git push … main` when none of the pending commits touched `CHANGELOG.md`, keeping release notes in lockstep with the tree.

### Changed

- **App icon matches Apple's macOS template** — all bundle icons (`icon.icns`, `icon.ico`, and the `*.png` ladder under `src-tauri/icons/`) are now squircle-masked with 824-px content on a 1024-px canvas, R=185 corners, and transparent padding around the tile. Previously the Dock and `.dmg` showed the raw square master, which clashed with every other app's rounded-corner shape. The raw master is preserved at `assets/icon-source.png`; `scripts/build_macos_icons.py` (runnable via `uv run`) regenerates the full bundle from it and is idempotent.
- **Settings page scaffolding** — new `SettingsPage` / `SettingsSection` primitives replace ad-hoc `SectionDivider` layouts across General / Capabilities / Hooks / Permissions / Providers / MCP / Models / Skills forms. Uniform title + description + body spacing; no more drift between tabs.
- **`cancel()` unblocks the ask_user gate** — stopping a stream while a clarification prompt is up now resolves every in-flight `ask_user` promise with a `[cancelled]` sentinel and clears the visible prompt, so the next turn doesn't inherit an orphaned gate.
- **Memory + Embedding settings reorganization** — auto-memory's toggle and embedding-model picker move out of Capabilities into two dedicated Settings tabs:
  - **Settings → Memory** keeps the auto-extraction toggle (now saves on change, no separate Save button) and points users to Models → Embedding for the backing model.
  - **Settings → Models** becomes a two-pane page with a full-width segmented tab strip — **Chat** (the existing LLM model configs) and **Embedding** (a new list/form mirroring the LLM shape, where each entry stores display name + model id + an optional **Gateway Provider ID**). Only one embedding entry is Active at a time; the chat LLM picker reorders providers to Anthropic → OpenAI → Google, and the Gemini label renders as "Google" to match Providers.
  - **Settings → Providers** adds an **Embedding base URL** input. Empty falls through to Chat → OpenAI. The per-embedding-config **Gateway Provider ID** rides along every request as an `X-Model-Provider-Id` header (matches the common enterprise-gateway shape like Mify's `/v1/embeddings`); direct OpenAI calls leave the field blank and no extra header is sent.
- **Embedding-aware proxy auth** — `api_key_for_url` now prefers `base_url_embedding_common` when matching, then falls through to the three chat URLs. A new lower-case `x-agora-provider-hint` header lets the frontend force-inject OpenAI auth for custom endpoints that don't prefix-match any configured URL; the hint header is stripped before the request is forwarded upstream.
- **Settings dialog closes on backdrop click** — `SettingsDialog` no longer passes `disablePointerDismissal`, so clicking outside the panel (main window, dialog backdrop) dismisses it as base-ui's default. The `focus-out` cancel in `onOpenChange` stays so dragging the window via `data-tauri-drag-region` doesn't collapse the panel when the webview briefly blurs.
- **Active model floats to the top of its list** — Settings → Models → **Chat** sorts each provider group with the active entry first (non-active rows keep their existing order); **Embedding** lifts the active config to the top of the flat list. Less scrolling to see which model is in use, especially once a provider has five or six entries.
- **Memory tab drops the embedding-model readout** — Settings → Memory is now single-section (just the auto-extraction toggle). The active embedding is already surfaced (and picked) under Settings → Models → Embedding, so repeating it here was redundant and tempted users to change it from the wrong place.

### Changed

- **Move logo assets to repo-root `assets/`** — `./assets/logo-{light,dark}.png` are now the canonical paths referenced by the README header.
- **`docs/` is now local-only** — internal design notes, roadmap, and TODO live outside of git (`docs/` is in `.gitignore`). The README no longer advertises a Documentation section.
- **Auto conversation title options** in Settings → General collapse into a 3-column segmented row (was a vertical stack of wide cards). Full hints moved to the native hover tooltip — saves ~3 lines of vertical space.
- **API key input never shows plaintext** — `MaskedKeyInput` now uses `type="password"` when focused, so the value is dot-masked live as the user types/pastes instead of revealing the raw string. Blurred state is unchanged (fixed 15-dot preview).

### Fixed

- **Launcher no longer double-dispatches into two conversations** — three layers of defense against a single launcher submit landing as two user turns across two conversations: (1) a `submittingRef` in `LauncherPanel` blocks re-entry from Enter key-repeat or fast double-press, reset via `onFocusChanged` when the launcher is re-summoned; (2) the `agora-background-action` listener in `App.tsx` uses a `cancelled` flag so the async `listen()` dispose is disarmed when the effect tears down before the promise resolves — previously `activeModelId`'s null → string transition on boot would re-run the effect before the first subscription resolved, leaking a second listener that handled every event twice; (3) `ChatArea` auto-send effect now reads `pendingFirstMessage` as a dep so it fires the moment the launcher stashes text, even when the target conversation is already current and the other deps wouldn't change.
- **Queue-chip selector infinite loop** — `QueuedChips` returned a fresh `[]` on every render when the current conversation had no queue, tripping React's "getSnapshot should be cached" guard and white-screening the app on conversation open. Now uses a stable `EMPTY_QUEUE` reference.
- **Active model persists across restarts** — clicking *Use* in Settings → Models now writes the selected model id into `global_settings.active_model_id` (new column), and startup reads it back before the "pick a fallback" logic runs. Previously, *Use* was in-memory-only and a restart fell back to the first model in the list.

## [0.1.0-alpha.1] — 2026-04-19

### Changed

- **Ad-hoc sign the macOS bundle** (`bundle.macOS.signingIdentity = "-"`) so Gatekeeper no longer rejects the `.dmg` with the misleading "damaged" message. Users on a fresh download only need `right-click → Open` once; the `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine` workaround is no longer required.

## [0.1.0-alpha] — 2026-04-19

First public preview. Everything stored locally under `~/.agora/`.

### Added

- **Chat runtime** on top of the Vercel AI SDK with Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google providers; per-model configuration and live test.
- **Built-in agent tools** (Rust): `read_file`, `write_file`, `edit_file`, `glob`, `grep`, `bash`, `bash_background`, `read_task_output`, `stop_task` — all scoped to a workspace root.
- **MCP support** — connect external Model Context Protocol servers, persisted and reconnected on launch.
- **Skills** — load markdown-based skill packs from `~/.agora/skills/`; optional script execution gated by a global toggle.
- **Conversation branching** — switch active leaves without losing alternative histories.
- **Agent capabilities** — approval prompts with per-tool allow rules, auto-approve for read-only tools, structured todos, conversation modes (including plan mode), subagents, lifecycle hooks.
- **Export & share** — Markdown and PDF export, plus a share-conversation command.
- **Search** — full-text search across conversations.
- **Default workspace root** — `~/.agora/workspace` applied on first launch so FS/Bash tools have scope without setup; editable via **Settings → General** (type/paste a path or use the directory picker).
- **Legacy-data migration** — one-shot move from `~/Library/Application Support/com.agora.app/` to `~/.agora/` on upgrade.

### Known limitations

- macOS build only; binaries are unsigned (expect a Gatekeeper prompt on first launch).
- No auto-update channel yet — grab new versions from [Releases](https://github.com/islgl/agora/releases).
- Cross-platform builds (Windows / Linux) are planned once CI is wired up.
